# Sandbox Security Enhancement Summary

## Task 5.3: Enhance Sandbox Security

### Overview
Enhanced the sandbox security system with comprehensive security controls, monitoring, and policy enforcement for Docker sandbox environments.

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. Security Policy Framework
- **ResourceLimits**: Configurable limits for memory, CPU, processes, network connections
- **NetworkPolicy**: Enum for different network access levels (NONE, INTERNAL, RESTRICTED, FULL)
- **SecurityPolicy**: Comprehensive policy configuration with:
  - Resource limits
  - Network policies
  - Allowed/blocked commands
  - File extension restrictions
  - File path pattern blocking
  - Monitoring settings
  - Violation thresholds

#### 2. Security Violation Tracking
- **SecurityViolationType**: Enum for different violation types
- **SecurityViolation**: Data class for violation records
- **SecurityMetrics**: Monitoring metrics collection

#### 3. SandboxSecurityManager Class
Core security manager with the following capabilities:

##### Security Policy Application
- `apply_security_policy()`: Apply comprehensive security policy to containers
- `_apply_resource_limits()`: Set memory, CPU, and process limits
- `_apply_network_policy()`: Configure network access restrictions
- `_apply_filesystem_restrictions()`: Restrict access to sensitive directories

##### Real-time Monitoring
- `start_monitoring()`: Begin security monitoring for containers
- `stop_monitoring()`: Stop monitoring for specific containers
- `_monitor_container()`: Continuous monitoring loop
- `_collect_metrics()`: Gather resource usage metrics
- `_check_violations()`: Detect security violations

##### Violation Detection
- Resource limit violations (CPU, memory, processes, network connections)
- Suspicious process detection
- Automatic container termination on threshold breach

##### Validation Services
- `validate_file_access()`: Validate file operations against security policy
- `validate_command_execution()`: Validate command execution against security policy

##### Reporting and Management
- `get_security_report()`: Generate comprehensive security reports
- `cleanup()`: Clean up security manager resources

#### 4. Enhanced SandboxManager Integration
- Lazy loading of security manager to avoid circular imports
- Security policy application during sandbox creation
- Security validation methods for file operations and command execution
- Security statistics in manager stats

#### 5. Enhanced DockerSandbox Integration
- Security validation for command execution
- Security validation for file read/write operations
- Permission error handling for blocked operations

#### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite
Created extensive test suites covering:

##### Unit Tests (`test_enhanced_security.py`)
- Security policy configuration
- Resource limits enforcement
- Network policy application
- File access validation
- Command execution validation
- Monitoring functionality
- Violation detection
- Container termination
- Security reporting

##### Integration Tests (`test_security_integration.py`)
- Sandbox manager security integration
- Docker sandbox security integration
- Security policy enforcement
- Security monitoring lifecycle
- End-to-end security workflows

### Security Features Implemented

#### 1. Resource Monitoring and Limits
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor and enforce memory limits with 10% tolerance
- **CPU Usage**: Monitor and enforce CPU usage limits with 20% tolerance
- **Process Count**: Limit and monitor number of running processes
- **Network Connections**: Limit and monitor network connection count
- **File Descriptors**: Set ulimits for open file descriptors

#### 2. Network Security
- **Network Isolation**: Complete network disconnection for NONE policy
- **Restricted Access**: iptables rules for limited external access
- **Private Network Blocking**: Block access to private IP ranges
- **DNS and HTTP/HTTPS**: Allow only essential network services

#### 3. File System Security
- **Sensitive Directory Protection**: Make system directories read-only
- **File Extension Filtering**: Allow only specified file extensions
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Block access to system paths
- **Working Directory Isolation**: Create restricted sandbox workspace

#### 4. Process Security
- **Command Filtering**: Block dangerous system commands
- **Process Monitoring**: Detect suspicious running processes
- **Privilege Restrictions**: Run with limited privileges

#### 5. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous security metrics collection
- **Violation Detection**: Automatic detection of policy violations
- **Threshold Management**: Configurable violation thresholds
- **Automatic Response**: Container termination on severe violations

#### 6. Audit and Reporting
- **Violation Logging**: Comprehensive violation record keeping
- **Security Reports**: Detailed security status reports
- **Metrics History**: Historical security metrics tracking
- **Event Correlation**: Link violations to specific containers

### Requirements Addressed

This implementation addresses the following requirements from the specification:

- **Requirement 5.3**: Enhanced sandbox security with restricted permissions and monitoring
- **Requirement 5.6**: Security policy enforcement and violation detection
- **Security Controls**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Resource Management**: Efficient resource monitoring and limits
- **Network Isolation**: Secure network policy enforcement
- **Process Monitoring**: Real-time process and activity monitoring

### Benefits

1. **Enhanced Security**: Multi-layered security controls protect against various attack vectors
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring provides immediate threat detection
3. **Configurable Policies**: Flexible security policies adapt to different use cases
4. **Automatic Response**: Automated violation response reduces manual intervention
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed audit trails support forensic analysis
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Resource usage tracking prevents system overload

### Usage Example

```python
from app.sandbox.core.security import SecurityPolicy, ResourceLimits, NetworkPolicy
from app.sandbox.core.manager import SandboxManager

# Create security policy
policy = SecurityPolicy(
    resource_limits=ResourceLimits(
        memory_mb=256,
        cpu_percent=25.0,
        max_processes=10
    ),
    network_policy=NetworkPolicy.NONE,
    blocked_commands={'rm', 'sudo', 'kill'},
    enable_monitoring=True,
    violation_threshold=3
)

# Create sandbox manager with security
manager = SandboxManager(security_policy=policy)

# Create secure sandbox
sandbox_id = await manager.create_sandbox()

# Validate operations
is_allowed = await manager.validate_command_execution(sandbox_id, "python script.py")
file_allowed = await manager.validate_file_operation(sandbox_id, "/work/data.txt")

# Get security report
report = await manager.get_security_report(sandbox_id)
```

### Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Threat Detection**: Machine learning-based anomaly detection
2. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Deep packet inspection for network monitoring
3. **Container Image Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning for container images
4. **Integration with SIEM**: Security Information and Event Management integration
5. **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance report generation
6. **Performance Optimization**: Optimized monitoring with reduced overhead

This implementation provides a robust foundation for secure sandbox operations while maintaining flexibility and performance.
