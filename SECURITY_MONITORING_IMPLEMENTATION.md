# Security Monitoring and Audit Logging Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive security monitoring and audit logging system implemented for OpenManus as part of task 5.4. The system provides real-time security event logging, threat detection, intrusion detection, anomaly monitoring, and automated alerting capabilities.

## Architecture

The security monitoring system consists of several interconnected components:

### Core Components

1. **SecurityEventLogger** - Central logging system for security events
2. **IntrusionDetectionSystem** - Anomaly detection and behavioral analysis
3. **SecurityAlertSystem** - Alert generation and notification management
4. **SecurityMonitoringMiddleware** - Integration layer for application monitoring
5. **SecurityEventProcessor** - Real-time event processing and automated response

### Data Models

- **SecurityEvent** - Individual security events with metadata
- **AuditLogEntry** - Audit trail entries for sensitive operations
- **SecurityAlert** - Security alerts with severity and recommendations
- **ThreatIndicator** - Known threat patterns for matching
- **AccessPattern** - User behavior patterns for anomaly detection

## Features Implemented

### 1. Security Event Logging with Threat Detection

#### Capabilities
- **Structured Event Logging**: All security events are logged with standardized metadata
- **Threat Type Classification**: Events are categorized by threat type (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- **Severity Levels**: Events are assigned severity levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- **Contextual Information**: Events include user ID, IP address, session ID, and operation context
- **Persistent Storage**: Events are stored both in memory and on disk for analysis

#### Usage Example
```python
from app.security.monitoring import log_security_event
from app.security.models import SecurityContext, SecurityLevel, ThreatType

context = SecurityContext(
    user_id="user123",
    ip_address="192.168.1.100",
    operation="file_access"
)

await log_security_event(
    event_type="suspicious_file_access",
    severity=SecurityLevel.MEDIUM,
    context=context,
    threat_type=ThreatType.SUSPICIOUS_PATTERN,
    details={"file_path": "/etc/passwd", "action": "read"}
)
```

### 2. Comprehensive Audit Trail

#### Capabilities
- **Operation Tracking**: All security-sensitive operations are logged
- **Result Recording**: Success/failure status with error details
- **Risk Assessment**: Operations are assigned risk levels
- **Correlation IDs**: Events can be correlated across system boundaries
- **Detailed Metadata**: Includes timestamps, user context, and operation details

#### Monitored Operations
- User authentication attempts
- File system operations (read, write, delete, execute)
- Network requests (especially external)
- Command execution
- Configuration changes
- Permission modifications
- Credential access

#### Usage Example
```python
from app.security.monitoring import log_audit_entry

await log_audit_entry(
    operation="file_operation",
    action="delete",
    context=context,
    resource="/important/file.txt",
    result="success",
    details={"file_size": 1024, "backup_created": True},
    risk_level=SecurityLevel.HIGH
)
```

### 3. Intrusion Detection and Anomaly Monitoring

#### Anomaly Detection Types
- **Rapid Failed Attempts**: Multiple failed login attempts in short time
- **Volume Anomalies**: Unusually high request rates
- **Time-based Anomalies**: Access outside normal hours
- **Behavioral Anomalies**: Unusual operation patterns for users
- **Geographic Anomalies**: Access from unusual locations/networks

#### Detection Algorithms
- **Pattern Analysis**: Tracks user behavior patterns over time
- **Threshold-based Detection**: Configurable thresholds for various metrics
- **Statistical Analysis**: Compares current behavior to historical patterns
- **IP Geolocation**: Detects access from unusual network ranges

#### Usage Example
```python
from app.security.monitoring import analyze_access_attempt

anomalies = await analyze_access_attempt(
    context=context,
    success=False,  # Failed attempt
    operation="login"
)

if anomalies:
    print(f"Detected anomalies: {[a.value for a in anomalies]}")
```

### 4. Security Alert System with Notifications

#### Alert Generation
- **Rule-based Alerts**: Configurable rules for different threat scenarios
- **Severity Classification**: Alerts are classified by severity (INFO to CRITICAL)
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents alert spam with configurable cooldown periods
- **Contextual Information**: Alerts include full context and recommended actions

#### Alert Types
- **Multiple Failed Logins**: Rapid authentication failures
- **High-risk Security Events**: Critical security violations
- **Unusual Access Patterns**: Behavioral anomalies
- **Threat Indicator Matches**: Known threat patterns detected

#### Notification Channels
- **Logging**: All alerts are logged to application logs
- **Extensible Framework**: Support for email, webhooks, Slack, SMS (configurable)

#### Usage Example
```python
from app.security.monitoring import security_alert_system

# Alerts are automatically generated when processing security events
await security_alert_system.process_security_event(security_event)

# Get active alerts
active_alerts = security_alert_system.get_active_alerts()

# Acknowledge an alert
await security_alert_system.acknowledge_alert(alert_id, "admin_user")

# Resolve an alert
await security_alert_system.resolve_alert(alert_id, "admin_user")
```

### 5. Threat Intelligence Integration

#### Threat Indicators
- **IP Addresses**: Known malicious IPs
- **User Agents**: Suspicious browser signatures
- **Patterns**: Malicious content patterns
- **Expiration**: Time-based indicator expiration
- **Sources**: Track indicator sources (internal, external feeds)

#### Usage Example
```python
from app.security.monitoring import add_threat_indicator

# Add a malicious IP indicator
indicator = add_threat_indicator(
    indicator_type="ip",
    value="192.168.1.200",
    threat_level=SecurityLevel.HIGH,
    description="Known botnet IP",
    expires_at=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=30),
    source="threat_intel_feed"
)
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Middleware Integration

The `SecurityMonitoringMiddleware` provides seamless integration with application operations:

```python
from app.security.integration import SecurityMonitoringMiddleware, monitor_security

middleware = SecurityMonitoringMiddleware()

# Monitor any operation
@monitor_security("sensitive_operation")
async def sensitive_function():
    return "result"

# Or use middleware directly
result = await middleware.monitor_operation(
    "operation_name", security_context, operation_function
)
```

### 2. Context Manager

For fine-grained monitoring control:

```python
from app.security.integration import SecurityMonitoringContext

async with SecurityMonitoringContext("database_query", context):
    # Monitored operation
    result = await database.query("SELECT * FROM users")
```

### 3. Automatic Monitoring

The system automatically monitors:
- Authentication attempts
- File operations
- Network requests
- Command execution

## Configuration

### Security Policy Configuration

```python
from app.security.models import SecurityPolicy, RateLimitConfig

policy = SecurityPolicy(
    max_input_length=10000,
    enable_xss_protection=True,
    enable_sql_injection_protection=True,
    enable_command_injection_protection=True,
    enable_path_traversal_protection=True,
    block_suspicious_requests=True,
    rate_limits={
        "login": RateLimitConfig(
            max_requests=5,
            time_window=timedelta(minutes=15),
            block_duration=timedelta(minutes=30)
        )
    }
)
```

### Alert Rules Configuration

```python
alert_rules = {
    "multiple_failed_logins": {
        "threshold": 5,
        "time_window": timedelta(minutes=15),
        "severity": AlertSeverity.HIGH,
        "description": "Multiple failed login attempts detected",
    },
    "high_risk_security_event": {
        "threshold": 1,
        "time_window": timedelta(minutes=1),
        "severity": AlertSeverity.CRITICAL,
